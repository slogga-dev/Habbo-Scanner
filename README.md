# Habbo scanner: your ultimate Habbo guide

Welcome to the world of Habbo, made even more exciting with the Habbo scanner extension. This isn't just any extension; it's your all-in-one companion, designed to make your Habbo experience richer and more immersive.

## What Does It Do?

Think of this extension as your personal Habbo detective. It's on a mission, exploring every room, cataloging every piece of furni, keeping tabs on bots, and even making friends with pets. It's got the whole of Habbo covered!

But that's not all. This extension is smart. It doesn't just scan; it remembers. Every furni it encounters, every bot it meets, and every pet it befriends - it stores all this information in a MySQL database. So, you can revisit this data anytime you want, analyze it, and uncover interesting Habbo insights.

## How does it work?

The extension uses G-Earth's API to interact with Habbo's client. When you activate the extension, it starts scanning the current room, identifying all the furni by their unique IDs and types. It also keeps an eye out for bots and pets, making sure no detail is missed.

As it explores, it also interacts with the navigator, ensuring it covers all rooms. If a room has doors or portals, the extension automatically moves through them, continuing its scanning process in the new room.

## Setting Up

Setting up the extension is simple. You need to have G-Earth and MySQL installed on your machine. Once you've got these, load the extension into G-Earth, enter your MySQL database details, and you're all set!

## Advanced features

The extension comes with a command system, allowing you to control its behavior directly from the game. It also tracks the movement of furni, recording the date and time of the movement. This way, you can keep track of changes in the rooms over time.

You can customize the extension using the `messages.properties`, `mysql.properties`, and `bot.properties` files. And if you want to share your Habbo adventures with your friends, there's a Discord bot that sends notifications to a Discord server whenever something significant happens in the game.

So, whether you're a serious Habbo user or just starting out, the Habbo scanner extension is your perfect Habbo companion. Enjoy your Habbo journey!
